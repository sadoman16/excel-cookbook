## **The Problem: Adding Numbers Shouldn't Be Hard**

You've got a column of 500 sales figures and need the total. You could click each cell and add them with `+` signs... but you'd be there until next Tuesday. Even selecting a range and looking at the status bar feels clunky when you need the total in a specific cell for your report.

`SUM` is the most-used function in Excel for a reason — it's fast, flexible, and essential for any spreadsheet work.

## **The Ingredients: Understanding SUM's Setup**

`SUM` adds up numbers. That's it. But it's more versatile than you might think.

`=SUM(number1, [number2], ...)`

| Parameter          | Description                                                       |
| :----------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `number1`          | The first number, cell reference, or range to add.                |
| `[number2], ...`   | Optional. Additional numbers or ranges (up to 255 arguments).     |

## **The Recipe (Step-by-Step): Totaling Sales**

**Scenario:** Sum monthly sales in cells `B2:B13`.

| Month    | Sales   |
| :------- | :------ |
| January  | $1,200  |
| February | $980    |
| March    | $1,450  |
| ...      | ...     |

1.  **Click cell B14** (where you want the total).
2.  **Type:** `=SUM(B2:B13)`
3.  **Press Enter.** Done! The total appears instantly.

### Multiple Ranges

Sum sales from multiple sheets or non-adjacent ranges:

```
=SUM(B2:B13, D2:D13, F2:F13)
```

Or across sheets:

```
=SUM(Jan!B2:B13, Feb!B2:B13, Mar!B2:B13)
```

## **Advanced Recipes**

### SUM with Conditions (Use SUMIF)

To sum only "North" region sales:

```
=SUMIF(A2:A100, "North", C2:C100)
```

### Running Total

Create a cumulative sum:

```
=SUM($B$2:B2)
```

Copy this down the column. Each row adds the current value to all previous values.

### Ignoring Errors

If your range might contain `#N/A` or other errors:

```
=SUMPRODUCT((IFERROR(B2:B13, 0)))
```

## **Pro Tips: Sharpen Your Skills**

*   **AutoSum shortcut:** Select a cell below your numbers and press `Alt + =` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + T` (Mac). Excel auto-detects the range.
*   **Text that looks like numbers:** `SUM` ignores text values. If "100" is stored as text, it won't be counted. Use `VALUE()` to convert first.
*   **Boolean values:** `TRUE` = 1, `FALSE` = 0, but only when passed directly (not in cell references). `SUM(TRUE, TRUE)` = 2, but `SUM(A1:A2)` where A1=TRUE, A2=TRUE = 0.

---

## **Troubleshooting: Common Pitfalls**

*   **Result is 0 when it shouldn't be:** Your "numbers" might be stored as text. Check the cell format or look for the green triangle warning.
*   **`#VALUE!` error:** One of your arguments isn't a valid number or range.
*   **Wrong total:** Check for hidden rows or filtered data. SUM includes hidden rows! Use `SUBTOTAL(109, range)` to sum only visible cells.
